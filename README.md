### About Mitron Bank 

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

### Objective of the Project 

The objective is to analyze this data and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide Mitron Bank in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends. 

### Problem Statment   

 * Demographic classification: Classify the customers based on available demography such as age group, gender, occupation etc. and provide insights based on them.
   
 * Avg income utilisation %: Find the average income utilisation % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). This will be your key metric. The higher the average income utilisation %, the more is their likelihood to use credit cards.
   
 * Spending Insights: Where do people spend money the most? Does it have any impact due to occupation, gender, city, age etc.? This can help you to add relevant credit card features for specific target groups.

 * Key Customer Segments: By doing above, you should be able to identify and profile key customer segments that are likely to be the highest-value users of the new credit cards. This includes understanding their demographics, spending behaviours, and financial preferences. 

 * Credit Card Feature Recommendations: Provide recommendations on what key features should be included in the credit card which will improve the likelihood of credit card usage. This should be backed by the insights from data provided and also some secondary research on the internet for this.

Develop a rewards system that resonates with the spending behaviors of salaried employees, self-employed individuals, and freelancers. This may involve offering cashback incentives on common expenditure categories like groceries, dining, and business-related costs.

Flexible Payment Options:
Provide versatile payment plans to accommodate varying income structures. This could entail offering customizable monthly payment schemes, empowering users to adjust their payment schedules based on their financial circumstances.

Expense Tracking and Budgeting Tools:
Incorporate built-in tools or collaborate with budgeting applications to assist users in monitoring their expenses, categorizing spending, and establishing budgetary objectives. Such features can be particularly valuable for freelancers and self-employed individuals managing fluctuating incomes.

Competitive Annual Fees and Interest Rates:
Maintain competitive annual fees and extend reasonable interest rates to attract and retain clientele. Consider introducing introductory offers, discounted rates for loyal patrons, or promotional deals tailored to specific spending categories.

Contactless and Mobile Payment Capabilities:
Ensure the credit card supports contactless payments and seamlessly integrates with popular mobile payment platforms. This enhances convenience for users who prefer digital and contactless transaction methods.

Enhanced Security Measures:
Implement advanced security protocols such as real-time fraud detection alerts, biometric authentication, and virtual card number generation to fortify transactional security. Effectively communicate these security measures to instill confidence and trust among users.
